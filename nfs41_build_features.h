 * spends lots of time waiting for the data to be split into
 * smaller chunks - this results in much reduced latency.
 *
 * Another benefit is that this gives a larger TCP window
 * (as Windows has no public API to set the TCP window size
 * per socket), resulting in better performance over WLAN
 * connections.

 * in Cygwin newlib-cygwin/winsup/cygwin/sec/acl.cc
 *
 * This assumes that the filesystem which storesthe ACL data leaves
 * them 1:1 intact - which is not the case for the Linux NFSv4.1
 * server (tested with Linux 6.6.32), which transforms the NFSv4.1
 * ACLs into POSIX ACLs at setacl time, and the POSIX ACLs back to
 * NFSv4 ACLs at getacl time.
 * And this lossy transformation screws-up Cygwin completly.
 * The best we can do for now is to skip such ACEs, as we have no
 * way to detect whether the NFS server supports full NFSv4 ACLs,
 * or only POSIX ACLs disguised as NFSv4 ACLs.
