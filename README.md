## 1\. <a name="build">Building from Source</a>

### Requirements

*   Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows 7 (Windows XP and previous versions are not supported)
*   Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
*   Windows Driver Development Kit (WinDDK 6000 or later)
*   ms-nfs41-client source code:   
    `> https://github.com/kofemann/ms-nfs41-client.git`

### Building the rpc library and nfs client daemon

*   WinDDK does not include the ldap library, so we build the rpc library and nfs client daemon with Visual Studio 2010.

1.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to **ms-nfs41-client\build.vc10**.
2.  Make a copy of **env.props.example**, and rename it to **env.props**.
3.  Open **env.props** in a text editor, and verify that the value in `<WDKPATH>C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.0</WDKPATH>` points to your WinDDK installation.
4.  Open the solution file **ms-nfs41-client.sln** in Visual Studio 2010.
5.  Select the desired configuration and platform (accessible via Build->Configuration Manager).
6.  Right-click on the **daemon** project and select Build. The project and its dependencies should build without errors. The resulting binaries, **nfsd.exe** and **libtirpc.dll**, can be found under **ms-nfs41-client\build.vc10\x64\Debug\**.

### Building the driver and utilities

1.  From the Start menu, open the WinDDK 'Checked Build Environment' for the target platform.
2.  Change directory to **ms-nfs41-client** and type `build`. All projects should build without errors.

### Signing the driver

1.  Open a WinDDK 'Checked Build Environment' as Administrator in this directory (right click and 'Run as administrator').
2.  Create a certificate for test-signing the driver ([Creating Test Certificates](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff540213%28VS.85%29.aspx "msdn.microsoft.com")):   
    `> makecert /pe /ss PrivateCertStore /n CN=nfs41_driver nfs41_driver.cer`
3.  Use the certificate to sign **nfs41_driver.sys** ([Test-Signing a Driver File](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff553467%28VS.85%29.aspx "msdn.microsoft.com")):   
    `> signtool sign /v /s PrivateCertStore /n nfs41_driver /t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timestamp.dll path\to\nfs41_driver.sys`

## 2\. <a name="install">Installing Binaries</a>

### Requirements

*   ms-nfs41-client binaries: **nfs41_driver.sys**, **nfs41_np.dll**, **libtirpc.dll**, **nfs_install.exe**, **nfsd.exe**, **nfs_mount.exe**
*   ms-nfs41-client configuration files: **nfs41_driver.cer**, **nfs41rdr.inf**, **install.bat**, **uninstall.bat**, **etc_netconfig**, **ms-nfs41-idmap.conf**
*   Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, or Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Libraries ([x86](https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8328) or [x64](https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=13523)). An installer for the redistributable libraries are included with binary releases.

### Instructions

1.  Copy or extract all ms-nfs41-client binaries and configuration files into a directory that's convenient for testing.
2.  Run **vcredist_x*.exe** to install the Visual C++ Redistributable Libraries.
3.  Double-click on **nfs41_driver.cer** and select 'Install Certificate', then place it in the 'Trusted Root Certificate Authorities' store.
4.  Open a command prompt as Administrator in this directory.
5.  Install the driver and update the registry:   
    `> install.bat`
6.  Copy configuration files:   
    `> mkdir C:\etc`   
    `> copy etc_netconfig C:\etc\netconfig`   
    `> copy ms-nfs41-idmap.conf C:\etc\`
7.  Allow windows to load test-signed drivers:   
    `> bcdedit /set testsigning on`
8.  Reboot.

## 3\. <a name="dfs">Disable the DFS Client</a>

*   The Windows DFS client interferes with some requests, indicated by long delays during operation. See [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171386](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/171386) for more information.

### Instructions

1.  Open **regedit.exe** and navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Mup`.
2.  Add a DWORD value named `DisableDfs` with a value of 1.

## 4\. <a name="ldap">Ldap Configuration</a>

### Requirements:

*   **C:\etc\ms-nfs41-idmap.conf** from [Installation](#install) step 7.

### Instructions

1.  Open **C:\etc\ms-nfs41-idmap.conf** in a text editor.
2.  Uncomment the `ldap_hostname` and `ldap_base` lines, and configure as appropriate to match your ldap server configuration (we'll add suggestions later).

## 5\. <a name="startup">Starting the Client</a>

*   If you've installed the binary distribution, you'll find two versions of the nfs client daemon: **nfsd.exe** and **nfsd_debug.exe**. **nfsd.exe** is built to run as a service, and does not provide easy access to debug output. We strongly recommend trying **nfsd_debug.exe** first (using the Instructions below) to verify that you can start the daemon and mount/unmount an nfs share. You can then close **nfsd_debug.exe** and start running **nfsd.exe** as a service with:  
    `> nfsd.exe -install`.

### Instructions

1.  From a Windows command prompt, run **nfsd.exe** to start the nfs client daemon. Leave this running in the background until all mapped drives are unmounted.   
    Usage:   
    `> nfsd.exe -d <debug level> [--noldap]`
    *   `<debug level>` determines the log verbosity (1, 2, 3 or 0 to disable)
    *   `--noldap` disables id mapping and uses a default uid=666 and gid=777
    *   `--uid, --gid` changes the default uid/gid when no mapping is available (must be nonzero)

## 6\. <a name="mount">Mounting</a>

### Instructions

1.  From a Windows command prompt run **nfs_mount.exe** to mount a share:   
    `> nfs_mount.exe Z: <server_name>:\`
2.  To specify the security flavor, add the 'sec=' mount option with sys, krb5, krb5i, or krb5p:   
    `> nfs_mount.exe -o sec=<flavor> Z: <server_name>:\`
3.  You can later unmount with:   
    `> nfs_mount.exe -d Z`

## 7\. <a name="cthon">Connectathon</a>

### Requirements

*   [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com "www.cygwin.com"), including packages gcc-core, make, time, tirpc, git
*   [Connectathon Test Suite](https://git.linux-nfs.org/?p=steved/cthon04.git;a=summary "git.linux-nfs.org")
*   ms-nfs41-client source code (patches for connectathon are located in **ms-nfs41-client\tests**)

### Instructions

1.  Extract **nfstests.zip** into a directory that's convenient for testing (i.e. **cthon04**).
2.  Open a Cygwin shell, and change directory to **cthon04**.
3.  Create a git repository to track changes:   
    `> git init`   
    `> git add *`   
    `> git commit -m "files from nfstests.zip"`
4.  Apply all cthon patches:   
    `> git am /path/to/ms-nfs41-client/tests/*.patch`
5.  Build the tests:   
    `> make`
6.  Run the test suite on a mounted directory:   
    `> ./runtests -a -t z:/testdir`

## 8\. <a name="issues">Known Issues</a>

*   krb5p security with AES keys do not work against the linux server, as it does not support gss krb5 v2 tokens with rotated data.
*   When recovering opens and locks outside of the server's grace period, client does not check whether the file has been modified by another client.
*   If nfsd.exe is restarted while a drive is mapped, that drive needs to be remounted before further use.
*   Symbolic links are not supported in Cygwin. Connectathon's basic test8 and special test nfsidem have been commented out.
*   Does not allow renaming a file on top of an existing open file. Connectathon's special test op_ren has been commented out.
*   Extended attributes are supported with some limitations: a) the server must support [NFS Named Attributes](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5661#section-5.3 "RFC 5661: 5.3\. Named Attributes"), b) the order of listings cannot be guaranteed by NFS, and c) the EaSize field cannot be reported for directory queries of FileBothDirInformation, FileFullDirInfo, or FileIdFullDirInfo.
